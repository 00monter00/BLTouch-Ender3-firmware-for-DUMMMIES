## Just copy it to microSD. Thats all. 
Instant firmware Marlin 2.0bugfix binary for those, who upgraded Ender 3 with:
- [SKR MINI E3 v1.2](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3/blob/master/hardware/BTT%20SKR%20MINI%20E3%20V1.2/BTT%20SKR%20MINI%20E3%20V1.2manual.pdf) motherboard, in which BLTouch is plugged INSTEAD of Z-stop (in "Z-stop" socket, not in "probe" socket) 
- [BLtouch v3.1](https://www.antclabs.com) (genuine) mounted with popular 3d printed [mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3003725) from thingiverse, or my [simplification](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4097908) of it.


1.Copy file firmware.bin to microSD card

2.Turn OFF Ender3 and stick card into slot

3.Turn ON Ender3 - it will upgrade firmware by itself, nothing to select or confirm by user

4.Remove microSD card from Ender3 and put it into PC. If file extension is changed by printer from "firmware.bin" to "firmware.cur", it means that this binary file is your CURrent firmware, already uploaded by Ender 3 into its mainboard.

THATS ALL
