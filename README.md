Ready to use Binary for BLTouch upgrade for Ender 3
### Installing the BLTouch
I used a mount that came with the BLTouch. But there are many printable mounts on Thingiverse.

When I first got the printer started up, the display and the BLTouch wouldn't turn on. I had to switch the blue and red wires on my BLTouch in order to get it to work (Like the guy in the Teaching Tech video had to do with the brown and red). Apparently there's no standard to wire colors so maybe see if it works first and if not try switching them. To switch the wires, I was able to use the little flathead screwdriver that came with the Ender 3 to carefully pull up the tiny plastic flaps on the connector to the board to pull out the wires and switch them. The BLtouch Troubleshooting section of [this readme](https://github.com/gazcbm/Marlin-2.0.x-SKR-Mini-E3-v1.2) covers some other wiring issues you might encounter, but I didn't have these problems.
